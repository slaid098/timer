A console cyclic timer in Rust that plays a random .mp3 or .wav from a set of audio signals after a set time has elapsed. The sound alerts continue until they are interrupted manually by entering the word 'break' and pressing the ENTER key. After the interruption, the timer resumes.

It will be useful for those who want to take breaks from time to time when working at a computer. The timer time in seconds is set in the config.yml file

You can add your own sounds to the /sounds folder in .mp3 or .wav format.
