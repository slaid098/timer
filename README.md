A console-based cyclic timer on Rust that plays a random .mp3 or .wav from a set of sounds after a specified time has elapsed. The sound alerts continue until manually interrupted by the 'ENTER' key. After the interruption, the timer resumes.

It will be useful for those who want to take breaks from time to time when working at a computer. The timer time in seconds is set in the config.yml file

You can add your own sounds to the /sounds folder in .mp3 or .wav format.
